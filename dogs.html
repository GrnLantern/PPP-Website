            <p class="mainContentP">The World Canine Organization recognizes over 300 breeds of domestic dogs, a very social and diverse animal. Science shows a direct link between
                dog adoption and health benefits for both dog and owner. Dogs are known to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression, ease loneliness, encourage exercise and playfulness, and even improve your cardiovascular health 
                according to the American Heart Association Jounal found <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554" target="_blank" >here</a>.

         <p class="mainContentP">
            Dogs, like other animals, require different feeding regimens throughout their lifespans. When possible, puppies should be nursed by their mothers
            for the first few months of life, bottle fed if mother is unavailable. After this puppies should be fed 3 times a day until they are 6 months old, then twice
            a day from 6 months to 1 year. The ASPCA has a best practices article for feeding dogs throught their life that can be found 
            <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips" target="_blank">here</a>.
         </p>
         <p class="mainContentP">
            It is extremely important for your dogs health for them to stay hydrated as dog's body is comprised of 60 - 70% water. Even a 10% loss of body water
            can cause serious illness and 15% loss can be fatal. 
         </p>
         <p class="mainContentP">
            Dogs and humans alike need regular daily exercise to remain healthy. Also like humans, fresh air and sunshine are both physically and mentally beneficial to 
            your furry friends. Ecercise types and durations will vary depending on the type of dog as well as any health conditions but range from between 30 minutes
            to 2 hours per day. This does not mean you need to rush out and sign your dog up for a CrossFit class, a nice walk around the block once or twice a day combined with 
            some play with age appropriate dog toys can be more than enough. Bark has a list of their coolest dog toys to promote fun exercise

        <h2 class="catH2" id="groomingHandling">Grooming and Handling</h2>
        <p class="mainContentP">
            Nutrition and exercise are not the only factors in your dog's health, grooming and handling are also important. Dogs require regular brushing 
            to avoid matting and tangling which can cause skin and health problems. Frequent brushing can also help reduce shedding and is a great way to keep an eye out for 
            fleas, ticks, and other unwanted pests. Depending on your dogs strength and disposition, regular bathing can be good exercise for both of you. It is best to use shampoo
            formulated for your dog and any underlying symptoms you may be trying to treat, like dry skin or fleas. After shampooing it is important to make sure your dog's fur is 
            completely rinsed of any leftover shampoo to avoid skin irritation or rashes. 
        </p>
        <p class="mainContentP">
            Always handle your dogs with love and care do avoid accidental injury. Smaller dogs can be carried with one hand under the chest and the arm extenting down their 
            hind quarters. Larger dogs require a two armed approach. One arm extended under the chest and the other extended under the rear, perpendicularly to the dog. Be 
            sure to lift with your legs and watch your dog for signs of discomfort or pain.
        </p>
        

        <h2 class="catH2" id="vaccinationMedication">Vaccinations and Medications</h2>
        <p class="mainContentP">
            It is essential to consult with your veterinarian about the best vaccination schedule for your dog. There are a standard set of vaccines recommended for all 
            dogs, including rabies, parvovirus, canine hepatitis, and distemper. Your vet may also recommend additional vaccines based on your dog's lifestyle and risk factors.
            The ASPCA has an article further explaining vaccinations <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="mainContentP">
            Medications are another important aspect of your dog's health. It is very important to consult with your vet before giving any medication to your furry friend. 
            Your vet may recommend monthly heartworm medication, flea and tick prevention, or other medications based on your dog. Be sure to follow instructions carefully 
            and ask your vet if you have any questions or concerns.
