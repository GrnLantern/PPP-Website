                set of guidlines for care and diet but with over 60 different cat breeds in the world it can be a lot to catalogue. Here we will provide general care and diet information for cats of any breed, broken

            Whenever possible it is best practise to have kittens of this age nurse directly from their mother. Kittens should be monitered closely to ensure they are
            growing at the correct weight and are healthy. Kittens may need to be fed from a bottle or other feeding device if it is noted that they are not gaining weight.
            Kittens may not gain weight at an appropriate for several different reasons including but not limited to:

            Formula should be specifically designed for kittens and should be served at body temperature. The Spruce Pets has an article on best kitten formulas that can be found

            Around 3 to 4 weeks after birth kittens should be introduced to solid food. Initially this should be done by mixing formula with wet kitten food. The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips" target="_blank">
                Cat Nutrition Page</a> of the ASPCA website suggests kittens should eat between hald and a cup of dry food or six to 9 ounces of wet food per day.  
                It also states that kittens struggling to eat dry food can have small amounts of water added to the food to make it softer. Ensure you are using food 
                for kittens as they provide the correct balance of nutrients to help your kitten grow. Architechtural Digest has a list of "The Best Kitten Food of 2024" <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/pets/best-kitten-food" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <p class="mainContentP">
            No longer considered kittens, cats in this age range need less nutrients. Cats within this age range should be fed twice a day and food should NOT be left out between feedings.
            After 1 year old cats level of activity will decrease and their metabloism will start to slow, by ensuring your cat is only eating at the appropriate times 
            and the correct amounts you can help reduce the risk of obesity and other health issues. Cats.com has a list of their top picks for cat foods

            Like all living beings our elderly felines need different care and activity levels than their younger counterparts.  
            Cats at this stage should be fed a diet of higher protiens and lower fats and calories. It is important to read product labels for 
            specific protein types, like salmon, as oppossed to broader categories like "meat" which could contain filler products and less proteins.
